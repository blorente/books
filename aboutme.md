## Hi!

I'm Borja. Software Engineer by day, and Sci-Fi author by night, or any other time I can squeeze between work, cats D&D, the gym, and sleeping.
I've only written one book so far, but I enjoyed the process so much that I hope to have another book out soon.

Born in Spain, I now live in London, UK, with my wonderful girlfriend and our two cats, Ember and Cinder.
When I'm not making stuff up, I can be found working in developer tooling for one company or another, most recently Twitter and Apple, playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends, and in the gym.

Very nice to meet you!
