<p><strong>When the city turns on itself, she can’t protect everyone.</strong></p>

<p>It was a regular day for Erika Belcroft, Inspector in training. Crack a smuggler's hideout, capture the asset, extract information, and track down the guns. It should have been simple.</p>

<p>But guns weren’t the only thing shipped into Decorat.</p>

<p>Someone else landed with them. Someone dangerous. Someone lethal. Someone trained to slip into the fabric of the city and tear its foundations from the inside.</p>

<p>When the city turns on itself, who will she turn to?</p>

<p><strong>The Second entry in the Decorat Burning Series, just as action-packed as the first!</strong></p>
