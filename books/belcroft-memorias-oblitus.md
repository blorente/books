<p><strong>When the city turns on itself, who will she turn to?</strong></p>

<p>It should have been simple.</p>

<p>Crack a smuggler's hideout, extract information, and track down the guns.</p>

<p>With cases like these, Erika Belcroft’s ascent to Inspector would be easy.</p>

<p>But with the weapons came someone else. Someone lethal. Someone willing and able to slip into the city’s fabric and tear it apart.</p>

<p>When a new threat meets old enemies, when the city turns on itself, who will she turn to?</p>

<p><strong>The Second entry in the Decorat Burning Series, just as action-packed as the first!</strong></p>
