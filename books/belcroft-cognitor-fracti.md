<p><strong>It's the 10th millennium. In grim Decorat, no mind is safe.</strong></p>

<p>Major Erika Belcroft punched the wall. Her career had gone up in smoke the moment she received the message. On the brink of a promotion, too. Crap</p>

<p>In a metropolis of billions where people's minds are cheaper than computers, a few more hundred missing wouldn't matter. There is always more to feed the hunger of the Grand Archive</p>

<p>But this time, it wasn't just anyone. Somebody had taken her father</p>

<p>She will go back. She will wade through the rotten, violent, gang-ruled underbelly of her home city. She will find him, whatever the cost</p>

<p>But the city strikes back. She will soon discover that some questions lead to deadly answers</p>

<p><strong>Blade Runner meets Gregor Eisenhorn from Warhammer 40.000, with a dash of Altered Carbon!</strong></p>
