<p><strong>No mind is safe.</strong></p>
<p>It's the 10th millennium. In Decorat, billions of workers spend their collective minds sieving through eons of data. Who cares about their sanity -- there are always more people.</p>

<p>Four decades after leaving her homeworld, Major Erika of House Belcroft receives an urgent message pleading for her return to Decorat. People are disappearing in the hundreds and her father is amongst them.</p>

<p>Her investigation pulls her and her cat Tristan out of the comfortable Spires, under the smog layer, and into the city's rotten underbelly. But in the hidden urban depths of Decorat, some questions lead to deadly answers. </p>
