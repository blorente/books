# Welcome!

Welcome to my little corner of the internet!
This is will be the central hub for all the information about my books.
For now, thugh, it's still under construction.

## Who am I?

I'm Borja Lorente, a Software Engineer with a passion for exploring imaginary worlds.
My titles only include this very volume you see below, but I enjoyed the process so much that I hope to have another book out soon.

Born in Spain, I now live in London, UK, with my wonderful girlfriend and his two cats, Ember and Cinder.
When I'm not making stuff up, I can be found working in developer tooling for one company or another, most recently Twitter and Apple, playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends, and in the gym.

Very nice to meet you!
